# Design Patterns Lab – Python Implementation

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python programs that demonstrate various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and classic software design patterns. These examples were developed as part of our third-semester Design Patterns lab coursework.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- **CAT - 1 / CAT - 2** – Internal assessment lab exercises (design patterns covered in CAT)
- **Exception** – Exception handling examples
- **Other Patterns** – Additional design patterns in CATs
- **Regex** – Regular expression examples
- **serialization** – Object serialization and deserialization examples
- **pdp doc / Pdp Lab** – Supporting documents and lab submissions

## 📌 Key Topics Covered

- Singleton Pattern (Type1, Type2, Type3)
- Observer Pattern (`observer.py`, `event_observer.py`)
- Strategy Pattern (`Strategy_calculator.py`)
- Template Method Pattern (`template.py`)
- Iterator Pattern (`iterator_Example.py`, `iter1.py`)
- State Pattern (`Traffic_State.py`, `Document_State.py`)
- Static and Class Methods
- Decorators and Customized Decorators
- Multiple Inheritance, `kwargs`, Abstract Classes

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.x

## 📚 Usage
